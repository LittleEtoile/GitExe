Martin Luther King, Jr., was one of the most important leaders of the civil rights movement in America. He fought against the policy of segregation that existed in the country. By profession, he was a Baptist minister, which was one of the few avenues that allowed black people to take up a leadership role.
While he gave many speeches in his life, the 'I Have a Dream' speech has been hailed as one of the most moving, evocative, and momentous speeches made in the history of not only America, but of the world. He delivered it from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, on the 28th of August, 1963, during the famous March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
In his speech, Martin Luther King spoke resonantly about his hopes of a future where African-Americans, and all people of all other ethnicities that were discriminated against, would break the shackles of inequality and injustice, and coexist with each other along with the whites in harmony, and as equals.
Through his speech, he informed, inspired, and lifted not only the 200,000 to 400,000 supporters of the civil rights movement gathered there, but the world at large. It was addressed to the generations of that time as well as to the future generations to come.
